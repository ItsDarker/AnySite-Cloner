# AnySite-Cloner
Clone site using WebScraping(BeautifulSoup)


Please note that web scraping without permission is unethical and in some cases illegal. Make sure to only use this code for educational purposes or with permission from the website owner.

This script uses the requests library to download web pages, the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML, and the os library to create folders and save files locally. It first creates a folder with the website's name and downloads all the resources (CSS, JS, images) from the web page, saving them locally in the same folder. It then replaces the URLs in the HTML with the local paths and saves the modified HTML locally as index.html.
